# 🚗🌄 Hill Climb Racing 3d - Procedural ( Mini Project ) 

The project contains all the necessary tools to get you started with your game including procedurally generated Terrains and Trees, stones, and other obstacles.
- Define the scope of generation ( higher scope means higher processing complexity )
- Define the obstacles / Trees to be instantiated.
- Define the car's attributes.

And you are ready to go!🍾
